# Base-Converter-GUI
An extra for my APCS 2019 base converter project. Has a GUI and stuff. Yea
# Copy and Paste from original README

The bog standard BaseConverter.java is located in src. Do all the grading on that file because it follows the rubric. For
the extra run BaseConverterGUI.java. It should also be in src. DO NOT RUN CONTROLLER.JAVA, IT WONT DO ANYTHING. All files are
marked with javadocs for your convenience. Controller.java is integral for the GUI to work so most of the extra is there.

GUI HELP
The first tab is a file converter. You can either drag & drop files/directories or click for a file chooser. The first
"file" icon is the "values.dat". The second file icon is where converted.txt is saved (a directory). The next tab is
number converter. Pretty self-explanatory, you enter a number, an input base, and an output base. Ounce you press convert
it will display on the label. The second to last tab is a random number generator. It creates a random number of a random
base everytime you click randomize. Last tab is a help menu. (P.S. The GUI leaks memory like a mothertrucker and crashes
periodically. Sorry 'bout that, didn't have the know-how to fix it)

My computer has trouble running running java code outside of IntelliJ. The code should be formatted so it can run anywhere.
If it has troubles on your computer please email me. I don't want to get a F because it doesn't run.

THANKS
